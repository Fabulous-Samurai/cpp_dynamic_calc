```

## 🎨 **Visual Verification Guidelines**

### What to Look For:
1. **Continuity**: Smooth curves should appear continuous (no gaps)
2. **Symmetry**: Functions like x^2, cos(x) should show expected symmetry
3. **Intercepts**: Check if curves cross axes at expected points
4. **Asymptotes**: Functions like 1/x should show vertical/horizontal asymptotes
5. **Periodicity**: Trigonometric functions should show repeating patterns
6. **Growth Rates**: Exponential functions should show characteristic growth

### Common Issues to Report:
- ❌ Missing points in continuous functions
- ❌ Incorrect axis crossing points
- ❌ Wrong curve shapes (parabolas not U-shaped, etc.)
- ❌ Scaling issues (functions appearing too compressed/stretched)
- ❌ Asymptote handling problems

## 🚀 **Advanced Testing**

### 11. Combined Function Tests
```bash
# Test 36: Sum of functions
plot(sin(x) + cos(x), 0, 360, -2, 2)
# Expected: Wave with amplitude √2

# Test 37: Product of functions
plot(x * sin(x), 0, 360, -360, 360)
# Expected: Sine wave with increasing amplitude

# Test 38: Composite functions
plot(sin(x^2), -5, 5, -1.5, 1.5)
# Expected: Increasingly rapid oscillations away from origin

# Test 39: Function with our calculus operations
plot(x^2, 0, 3, 0, 9)
# Verify this matches integrate(2*x, x, 0, t) for various t values
```
